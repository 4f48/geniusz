# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please only report vulnerabilities if it affects the version of Geniusz which is accessable trough the website.  
Older versions of the website are not supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, or a critical bug, please **do not open an issue and do not publish a pull request fixing it**. Rather, report it trough the Security tab on this repository, or email me at 0x4f48@proton.me (use my [GPG key](https://github.com/4f48.gpg)), so we can discuss and patch it privately.
